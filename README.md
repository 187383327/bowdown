use `tools/tools.html` to run bots or run the spatial indexer. Select the bot files or gltf/glb file. Indexer can take a very long time to finish. The page can become unresponsive for hours.

and to record a new bot: start recording with 'R', then stop with 'R' again. Then look at the console to copy/paste the bot into a new json file
